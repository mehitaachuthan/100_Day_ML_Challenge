# 100_Day_ML_Challenge
Inspired from other peoples work on 100 Day ML Challenges

# Motivation
I have often wanted to learn more about the exciting field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Whenever I try to get started, I feel like I end up in circles and do not seem to get far. By documenting my journey of learning as I work through a project, I am going to try to keep up the habit of learning and try to explore by implementing concepts that I learn.
I will go more deeply into computer vision and imaging technology specifically, but also explore voice and text.
Follow along on CS229, CS230, CS231N lectures
